# Creative Portfolio ðŸš€

This is my personal testing ground where Iâ€™m experimenting with **React**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and cool animation libraries like **GSAP** and **React Bits**.  

Currently, Iâ€™m building and testing interactive portfolio animations such as text-splitting, staggered reveals, and smooth transitions.  
This is **not yet a final project** â€” just me exploring and having fun while learning! ðŸŽ¨âš¡

## Why this repo?  
Iâ€™m using this repository to:  
- Try out animation libraries like [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)  
- Experiment with landing page layouts and UI effects  
- Practice Git/GitHub workflow (commits, branches, pushes, PRs)  
- Showcase my progress in becoming a **Full Stack Developer**
